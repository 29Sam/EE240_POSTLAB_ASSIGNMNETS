q1)
n=100 turns for inductor 
A =30 cm^2
magnetic core length =10cm
f=50 Hz 
for my roll number ie 24b1312 - Bs =0.95+0.01*12  T =   1.07 tesla 
alpha = 40 A/m
for me vrms = 80 +12 = 92 V  or vrms= 92 root2
to find current waveform 
so B=  1.07 taninv( H/40) + (u0) H ; where u0 will be permeability of free space hopefully
So relation of B vs H is known .
phi =B*Ac    and L=n phi/I    and H=n I/L
